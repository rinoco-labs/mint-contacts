# Water Cooler
The Galliun Water Cooler protocol is a minting and distribution package for NFT collection launches on Sui. Projects can use Water Cooler as a temporary structure which is first filled with NFTs by creators and then distributed to buyers. It allows creators to bring their digital assets on-chain in an easy and customisable way.

## Flow CLI
Creates can use [Flow](https://github.com/VisionDeCreator/flow "Flow") to handle the whole process. For the creation, configuration, upload of NFT data and state management of a Water Cooler.
